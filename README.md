#  Brief Me The Case: AI-Powered Legal & News Summarizer

> A powerful multi-model AI summarization engine for transforming lengthy legal and journalistic content into concise, human-readable summaries — featuring abstractive, extractive, and rewriter modules.

 **Deployed with FastAPI**  
 **ROUGE, BERTScore, Perplexity Evaluated**  
 **Powered by BART, T5, and DistilBERT**

##  Objective

**Brief Me The Case** is a transformer-based summarization platform designed for domains where clarity and accuracy are critical — like **legal documents** and **news articles**.

It supports:
-  Abstractive summarization (BART)
-  Extractive summarization (DistilBERT + LoRA)
-  Fluency-enhancing rewriters (T5 and BART)
-  Human-in-the-loop interface for summary refinement

##  Datasets Used

| Dataset | Domain | Source |
|---------|--------|--------|
| BillSum | Legal Bills | U.S. Congressional Bills |
| MultiNews | Journalism | Multiple News Outlets |
| CNN/DailyMail | Extractive | HuggingFace Datasets |

##  Model Architecture

###  Abstractive Summarizer (BART)
- Encoder-Decoder architecture using `facebook/bart-large-cnn`
- Handles up to 1024 token input
- Cross-Entropy loss + AdamW + LR warmup

###  Extractive Summarizer (DistilBERT + LoRA)
- Sentence-level regression model
- ROUGE-L scoring for supervision
- Fine-tuned with 1% data subset
- Low-Rank Adaptation for fast training

###  Rewriter Models
- **T5-base**: Improves fluency of decoder-generated text
- **BART-base**: Enhances structure, tone, and coherence
- Evaluation: ROUGE-1/2/L, BERTScore, GPT-2 Perplexity, Readability

##  Deployment Screenshots

The **Brief Me The Case** web app is deployed on a FastAPI backend and supports an end-to-end summarization pipeline — combining extractive, abstractive, and rewriter stages. The following screenshots illustrate the core functionality and user interface flow.

> The homepage allows users to input legal or news documents and initiate summarization using the **"Generate Summary"** button.

> After summarization, the interface displays the output along with options to **"Humanize Summary"** or **"Try Another"** document. This step shows the raw output from the decoder model.

> The final step displays a fluency-enhanced version of the summary, generated by the rewriter module. Users can return to the start and run a new summary cycle.
